# BOSH Google CPI release

This is a [BOSH](http://bosh.io/) release for the external [BOSH Google CPI](https://github.com/frodenas/bosh-google-cpi/).

## Disclaimer

This is NOT presently a production ready [BOSH Google CPI](https://github.com/frodenas/bosh-google-cpi/) BOSH release. This is a work in progress. It is suitable for experimentation and may not become supported in the future.

## Usage

I am assuming you are familiar with [BOSH](http://bosh.io/) and its terminology. If not, please take a look at the [BOSH documentation](http://bosh.io/docs) before running this procedure.

### Setup the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) environment

* [Sign up](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/signup) and activate Google Compute Engine, if you haven't already.

* [Download and Install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) the Google Cloud SDK command line tool.

* [Initialize](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud/reference/init) the gcloud CLI if you haven't done so previously. Choose one of the following:

  * Use the CLI-guided walkthrough:

    ```
    $ gcloud init
    ```

  * Manually initialize the CLI:

    1. Create a [service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount) and securely store the downloaded **JSON Service Key**.

    1. Set the credentials:

      ```
      # Set ENV:
      export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=<path/to/SERVICE_KEY.json>

      # Or, use the CLI:
      $ gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file <path/to/SERVICE_KEY.json>
      ```

    1. Set the project configuration (see [Regions and Zones](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/zones)):

      ```
      $ gcloud config set project <PROJECT_ID>
      $ gcloud config set compute/region <REGION> # e.g., us-east1
      $ gcloud config set compute/zone <ZONE>     # e.g., us-east1-b
      ```

* Reserve a new [static external IP address](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances-and-network#reserve_new_static):

  ```
  $ gcloud compute addresses create bosh
  ```

* Create a new [network with auto-created subnetwork ranges](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#creating_a_new_network_with_auto-created_subnetwork_ranges):

  ```
  $ gcloud compute networks create cf --mode auto
  ```

* Create the following firewalls and [set the appropriate rules](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/networking#addingafirewall):

  ```
  $ gcloud compute firewall-rules create cf-internal \
      --description "Cloud Foundry Internal traffic" \
      --network cf \
      --source-tags cf-internal \
      --target-tags cf-internal \
      --allow tcp,udp,icmp

  $ gcloud compute firewall-rules create cf-bosh \
      --description "Cloud Foundry BOSH External traffic" \
      --network cf \
      --target-tags cf-bosh \
      --allow tcp:22,tcp:443,tcp:4222,tcp:6868,tcp:25250,tcp:25555,tcp:25777,udp:53
  ```

* Create a **password-less** [SSH key](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/adding-removing-ssh-keys) if you haven't already.

### Install the bosh-init CLI

Install the [bosh-init](https://bosh.io/docs/install-bosh-init.html) tool.

### Create a deployment directory

Create a deployment directory to store all `bosh-init` artifacts:

```
$ mkdir google-bosh-deployment
$ cd google-bosh-deployment
```

### Create a deployment manifest

Create a `google-bosh-manifest.yml` deployment manifest file inside the previously created deployment directory with the following content and update it with your properties:

```

### Deploy

Using the previously created deployment manifest, now we can deploy it:

```
$ bosh-init deploy google-bosh-manifest.yml
```

### Install the BOSH CLI

Install the [BOSH CLI](http://bosh.io/docs/bosh-cli.html) tool in your workstation.

Then target your BOSH environment:

```
$ bosh target <YOUR BOSH IP ADDRESS>
```

Your username is `admin` and password is `admin`.

2. Create a topic branch.
3. Implement your feature or bug fix.
4. Commit and push your changes.
5. Submit a pull request.

### Create new release

#### Creating a final release

If you need to create a new final release, you will need to get read/write API credentials to the [@cloudfoundry-community](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community) s3 account.

Please email [Dr Nic Williams](mailto:&#x64;&#x72;&#x6E;&#x69;&#x63;&#x77;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x6C;&#x69;&#x61;&#x6D;&#x73;&#x40;&#x67;&#x6D;&#x61;&#x69;&#x6C;&#x2E;&#x63;&#x6F;&#x6D;) and he will create unique API credentials for you.

Create a `config/private.yml` file with the following contents:

``` yaml
---
blobstore:
  s3:
    access_key_id:     ACCESS
    secret_access_key: PRIVATE
```

You can now create final releases for everyone to enjoy!

```
bosh create release
# test this dev release
git commit -m "updated BOSH Google CPI release"
bosh create release --final
git commit -m "creating vXYZ release"
git tag vXYZ
git push origin master --tags
```
